Somebody asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?" To that, Jesus replied with the parable of the Good Samaritan, who helped a wounded man he found on the side of the road. 

Many of us are one step ahead of Jesus. We have moved to safe neighborhoods where junkies don't mug poor strangers for us to find. We use ["walkability scores"](https://www.walkscore.com/) in our GPS directions to help us avoid those lonely, dangerous sidewalks. 

We would help the wounded man from the story if we ever came across him...but we won't. To us I say, good luck explaining that distinction to Jesus when we meet Him!
