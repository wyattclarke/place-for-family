What’s the smallest scale imaginable to foster healthy growth of young adults? What's the path to growth?
1.	Participate in a [home matching online marketplace](https://www.roomster.com/) as an intermediary. Rent a home and sublet to subjects. Design rules for subjects’ cooperation. Provide a minimal set of services like back-up childcare, tutoring, academic advising, job searching, government benefits and tax advice, etc. 
2.	Recruit more established adults to serve as mentors. 
3.	Lend reputation by helping get subjects jobs. Start a business that preferentially employs participants.
4.	Apply for grants to acquire real estate to use as permanent housing. Allow subjects to buy equity stakes, enabling rolling real estate purchases.
