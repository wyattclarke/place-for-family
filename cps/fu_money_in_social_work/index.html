<p>Many jobs have this feature, where you know from Day 1 that your employment will probably end dramatically. Like joining a presidential administration or becoming a stunt double. To do anything dangerous, including social systems change work, it helps to have a fallback. “Fuck you” money.</p>
<p>The basis of all negotiating power is maintaining outside options. If you have no financial alternative to keeping your job, what leverage do you have to push for change?</p>
<p>Squirreling away a financial reserve isn’t easy. The average BSW graduates with around $30k of student debt and a $45k post-tax salary. Here are some starting points to turn your ethical resolutions into credible plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mentally separate your fixed costs and variable costs of living. Your fixed costs are things like student debt and retirement saving. Variable costs include your grocery bill, rent, and utilities.</li>
<li>Find your fallback job now and adjust your variable costs to live on that second-best job’s salary.</li>
<li>Grok the time value of money. $0.04 saved at age twenty will be a dollar by retirement. At age thirty, it’s $0.08. At forty, $0.16. At fifty, $0.32. Your savings potential per dollar earned shrinks exponentially as you age.</li>
<li>Go to the online FIRE community for help. That’s “Financial Independence / Retiring Early”. It’s an active community of people trying to save aggressively, even if their motivations don&rsquo;t match yours.</li>
