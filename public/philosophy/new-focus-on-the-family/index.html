    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Growing up, Dad liked to listen to radio programs from an organization called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_on_the_Family">Focus on the Family</a>. It&rsquo;s a Christian media group centered on the premise of &ldquo;helping families thrive.&rdquo; I always loved that goal. Anyone with a family knows how hard family life can be!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Focus on the Family preaches a narrow vision of how family should look. Their focus is promoting the health of traditional married couples with children. To be clear, that&rsquo;s a good vision of family, but I want to argue that it&rsquo;s too narrow in 2020. <em>We need a group promoting health of the families we have, not just the families we wish we had.</em></p>
<p>(Focus on the Family is also frequently criticized for its social and political positions.  I won&rsquo;t explore those criticisms since they&rsquo;re not the focus of this post.)</p>
<p>Since the good and bad old days of the 1900s, divorce rates have risen, marriage rates have fallen, unmarried cohabitation has risen, and percent of kids being raised in 2-family households has fallen. A lot of other stuff has happened too, like falling church attendance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that these changes aren&rsquo;t spread evenly in society. Traditional norms of family life have stayed relatively intact for educated and affluent Americans since the 1990s. Meanwhile, family life for less-educated working class Americans is becoming less and less recognizable (see <em>Coming Apart</em> by Charles Murray). A class-based split in family formation trends is visible in the charts below, taken from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/04/upshot/up-birth-age-gap.html">New York Times infographic</a>. Uneducated, rural, and minority folks frequently start having kids at a young age while the educated, professional class more often waits until college is finished and their careers started to have kids.</p>

<p>Even though much has changed, Christ has built his church on a rock, and the gates of hell will still not overcome it. Christians are still called to tend Jesus&rsquo; sheep and meet people where they are. Humans are still social animals, and we still raise kids. There&rsquo;s still need for the Church to nurture families.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll conclude with open questions. How should the Church nurture families in 2020? How do we point folks toward a Biblical model of family life, but avoid bashing them over the head with it? What would a new focus on today&rsquo;s families look like?</p>
