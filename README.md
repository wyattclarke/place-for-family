# place-for-family
A spot to gather thoughts on creating housing institutions to support healthy, low-consumption, high-functioning family life.

# To add a blog post or alter the site
1. Add content in `/content` directory
2. Run `hugo` command in terminal to build static site files in `/public` directory
3. Git add, commit and push in two repos, confusingly both called `place-for-family`:
   - Private root repo in `/place-for-family` directory, which maintains the full Git
   - Public directory that feeds the static content to the website (wherever it is hosted), found in the `/place-for-family/public` directory
